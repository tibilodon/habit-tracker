//compiles all the styles in all the files in a folder and "sends" it
//shove _index.scss in every folder you want to do this to
//then you can just @use "../FOLDER NAME, but then you need to use eg.: color: vars.$redCol or import it as: @use "../vars" as a; then color:a.$redCol or @use "../vars" as * then color:$redCol
@forward "../variables/vars";
